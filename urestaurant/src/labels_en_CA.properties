privacyPolicy1=Welcome to Urestaurant\! We propose to build an event management system directed towards, but not limited to, independent hospitality operators. This system would allow users to create, share and manage events in both public and private domains. It will provide a means to invite other users or invite friends to join the application in order to receive exclusive invitations. The goal is to incorporate private/exclusive events with events that are publicly available in order to attract a thriving social community into a centralized hub. We are hoping the features of this application will be used to promote and organize all kinds of social events within the hospitality industry. Examples of events would include anything like dinner parties, potlucks, underground restaurants, and nightlife socials.Should you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to contact us at contact@urestaurant.com.
privacyPolicy2=The concept of the application is that any user can serve multiple roles. \
						Users can just browse public events and socialize in a public manner and/or users can gain access to more exclusive events. \
						All users are able to host an event themselves providing a hosting role to the user. Events have a single host, however prospectively in the future they may allow multiple hosts. The user groups roles provide admin features to manage a group of regular users. This is an abstract concept of a social group. The admin of these groups can accept new users to the group.
personalDataWeCollect=Personal data that we collect
privacyPolicy3=The application will store its user and event information as \
						well as accessory data such as invitations, reviews and peer to peer messages.\
						User information may include the user's name, email address, or any other identifyable information.
consent=Consent
privacyPolicy4=By using our application services, you are consenting to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
howWeUsePersonalData=How we use personal data			
privacyPolicy5=We allow users hosting events to invite other users, and you may receive emails \
						regarding such invitations for events from our application. If you provide personal data\
						in order to contact us, we may use such data to respond to you, for instance, through email. \
						If we are going to use any personal data in any way that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, \
						you will be informed of the use of such data before or at the time at which the data is collected.
